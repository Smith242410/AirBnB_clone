# The AirBnB Clone Project.

***
## Project Description
***
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python.

***
## Description of the Command Interpreter:
***
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the command available are:

* show
* create
* update
* destroy
* count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed: 

* Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
* Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Updating attributes of an object
* Destroying an object

## How to start it.
***

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

## How to use it

***
It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.
i
In Interactive mode, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

## This project tasks us to create a full web application:
## The AirBnB Clone project

During this project, we will be have to put different 
pieces together in order for this project to be a 
success. 

## Those pieces will be:
- The HTML/CSS template
- Database storage
- APIs
- Frontend integration
