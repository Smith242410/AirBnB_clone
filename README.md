This project tasks us to create a full web application:
The AirBnB Clone

During this project, we will be have to put different 
pieces together in order for this project to be a 
success. 

Those pieces will be:
- The HTML/CSS template
- Database storage
- APIs
- Frontend integration

We will also need to create a command interpreter which
will do a few basic functions like:
- Creating new objects(ex: new Users, Places, etc)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
- Do operations on objects
- Update attributes on an object
- Destroy an object

This will help us build our knowledge because we will have
to do some large-scale projects in the future.
